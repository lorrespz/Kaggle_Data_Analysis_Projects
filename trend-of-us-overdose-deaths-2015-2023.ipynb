A comprehensive list of synthetic opioids (which includes fentanyl) can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Synthetic_opioids\n\nPsychostimulants with abuse potential that include drugs such as methamphetamine account for the second largest portion of total overdose deaths. Cocaine is also responsible for a large portion of deaths, comparable to the one accounted by psychostimulants. \n\nOn the other hand, deaths by semi-synthetic opioids in Feb 2023 and heroin occurred much less that those caused by the synthetic opioids or psychostimulants or cocaine.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##  Deaths by synthetic opioids overdose in all states in February 2023","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_Feb23_syn_opioids = df23[(df23['Indicator'] == 'Synthetic opioids, excl. methadone (T40.4)') & (df23['Month']==2)]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-08T05:51:41.721499Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-08T05:51:41.722142Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-08T05:51:41.730121Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-08T05:51:41.7221Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-08T05:51:41.727983Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"f, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(14, 10), sharex=True)\nplt.title('US overdose deaths by synthetic opioids in Feb 2023')\nx=df_Feb23_syn_opioids['State']\ny1=df_Feb23_syn_opioids['Data Value']\nsns.barplot(x=x, y=y1, palette=\"rocket\", ax=ax1)\nax1.set_ylabel(\"Actual data\")\n\ny2 = df_Feb23_syn_opioids['Predicted Value']\nplot = sns.barplot(x=x, y=y2,  ax=ax2)\nax2.set_ylabel(\"Predicted data\")\nplt.setp(plot.get_xticklabels(), rotation=90)\nsns.despine(bottom=True)\n#plt.setp(f.axes, yticks=[])\nplt.tight_layout(h_pad=2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-08T05:51:41.732135Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-08T05:51:41.732722Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-08T05:51:43.395152Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-08T05:51:41.732676Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-08T05:51:43.393693Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data for Feb 2023 shows that California has the highest number of overdose deaths due to synthetic opioids in all states, followed by Florida.
